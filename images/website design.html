    <h1>Our Company</h1>
    <p>Humans have been storing and distributing water for centuries. Before, when people lived as hunters/ collectors, river water was applied for drinking water purposes. When people permanently stayed in one place for a long period of time, this was usually near a river or lake. When there were no rivers or lakes in an area, people used groundwater for drinking water purposes. This was pumped up through wells.
        When the human population started growing extensively, the water supply was no longer sufficient. Drinking water needed to be extracted from a different source.
        As far back as 500 BC it's believed that the famous Greek scientist, Hippocrates invented the first early water filterâ€¦ in the form of a cloth bag! This simple device was known as the 'Hippocratic sleeve'. The cloth acted like a sieve to filter out the impurities from the Greek aqueducts.
